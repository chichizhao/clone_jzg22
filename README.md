# clone_jzg22
This script we used for jzg population analysis with 2020 refenrence data

## 01 build the reference genome
Scripts we used for build the reference are in 01_ref.

## 02 check clone 
Scripts we used for checking clone and call variants are in 02_check_clone.

## 03 estimate population age
Scripts we uesd for estimating the T. latifolia clonal population age in 03_estimate_population_age.

## 04 clonal development routes
Scripts we uesd for build the clonal phylogenetic tree, and map the tree to the geographic locations in 04_clonal_development_routes.

## 05 characteristic of somatic mutations
Scripts we uesd for checking position, direction of somatic mutations. meanwhile, check the non-synonymous mutation site during the development and the vaf of somatic mutations in 05_position_direction_vaf.

## 06 data 
Files that we used as material or the file lists we used for analysis are in data.
