# Estimate the population clonal age
## 1. Average somatic mutation sites
#### based on the step phylogenetic tree we got the same site and different site between two samples and the same site to calculate the average somatic mutation sites of each sample

## 2. Estimate the population clonal age
#### fixed somatic mutations are calculate through the following python script
    usage: python check_fix_somatic_mutaions.py
